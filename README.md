Hello, im @polprog. I find fun in playing with all sorts of strange and unusual computers.
I do low and high level programming, as well as digital and analog electronic design.
You can reach me on IRC at libera.chat, on twitter under @polprogpl and on fedi at @gorplop@m68k.church.
Check out my website at https://polprog.net
